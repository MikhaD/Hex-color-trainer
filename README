I made this game in 2019 to improve my ability to recognize colors by their hexadecimal values and vice versa. You can play it [here](https://mikhad.github.io/color-game/).

Given a hexadecimal color value you need to choose the corresponding color from a palette of 9 options.
## Features
#### Multiple Configurations
You can choose to guess the color given the hexadecimal, RGB or HSL value, the other way around, or any combination.
#### 3 Game Modes
- **Speed**: Guess as many as you can within a configurable time limit
- **Timed**: Guess a given number as fast as you can
- **Zen**: Guess a given number without a time limit
- **Endless**: Keep guessing until you get bored
#### 6 Levels of difficulty
The higher the difficulty the closer the colors are to each other. The higher difficulties are virtually impossible.
#### Auto Play mode
The game will play itself and you can watch it.

When I originally completed the game the first thing I did was write a script in the console that played the game for me and always got a perfect score. I thought it would be fun to include it in the game.
## Recent Modifications
I recently came back to this game and discovered that it was no longer working. I fixed the issue that was causing it to break as well as some other long standing bugs, but tried to leave the code in a similar state to how it was when I originally wrote it.
